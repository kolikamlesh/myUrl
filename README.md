# myUrl
input any long url it will return short url in formate 'localhost:9000/resolve/xxxxxx'
this url is comparatively small to the given input and shared ifficiently among users
xxxxxxx this is 7 or more character long id according to the url 

it is md5 hash generated by system if any collision happens then it appends a serial number at last of id
e.g.

abcdefg
abcdefg1
abcdefg2
abcdefg3

and so on thats why we always have an id for every url
in this app there are two options provided redirect and copy by using them you can redirect or copy the url
